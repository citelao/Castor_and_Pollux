If you need help or run into problems, please reach out to us. Email is the best way for product issues, whereas Discord and GitHub are great for getting advice and help on how to customize your module. Send us an email File a bug on GitHub Reach out on the Discord Installing the module # To install this into your Eurorack setup: Connect a Eurorack power cable to your power supply and the back of the module. Note that even though the power connector on the module is keyed, double check that the red stripe is on the side labeled red stripe ! Screw the module to your rack's rails. Inputs and outputs # Castor & Pollux contains two separate oscillators. Each has two inputs with associated knobs: A pitch CV input. The range is 0v to +6v. A pitch knob. The range is -1 octave to +1 octave and is added to any incoming pitch CV. A pulse width CV input. This changes the pulse width of the pulse wave. The range is 0v to +5v. A pulse width knob. When combined with the pulse width CV it sets the minimum pulse width. Each oscillator also has three dedicated waveshape outputs: A ramp wave output A pulse wave output A sub square wave output Each waveshape is nominally 10v peak-to-peak. You can read more about the sound of each waveshape in the waveshape section. Each oscillator also has a waveshape mixer that contains level knobs for each waveshape and a mix output: The waveshape section also shows how mixing the waveshapes affects the waveshape and sound. There is also a combined output that mixes the output from both oscillators mixer together. It has a crossfader knob to determine which oscillator is more prominent in the mix: The oscillator stacking section has more details and sound samples of combining the oscillators together. Finally, there is a knob to enable chorusing and a button to enable hard sync: The chorusing section goes into more detail and has some sound samples, and the [hard sync][#hard-sync] section shows how hard sync affects the second oscillator. Waveshapes # Just like the Juno, Castor & Pollux has three waveshape outputs: ramp, pulse, and sub. The ramp wave looks like this (click the image to start and stop the animation): Simulation vs reality These are simulations of perfect waveshapes. Castor & Pollux's waveshapes are generated by analog circuitry and they don't quite look exactly like these examples. That's a good thing - the analog weirdness is what adds character to the module. The ramp sounds like this: The pulse wave depends on the pulse width CV and knob. You can vary the pulse width in this animation to see how it affects the waveshape: pulse width And here's some of the sounds you can get out of it: Finally, there's the sub waveshape. It's a square wave that's one octave lower. Here's what it looks like: And here's some sound samples of the sub waveshape: These these waveshapes can be mixed together to produce much more complex and interesting waveshapes - try playing with the sliders under this animation and seeing how it affects the waveshape: ramp volume pulse volume pulse width sub volume Here's some sound samples of various mixes: Oscillator stacking # Because Castor & Pollux has two oscillators, you can combine them together to build much more complex sounds. When there is no input into the second oscillator's pitch CV jack, it will follow the pitch of the the first oscillator. You can use the pitch knob of the second oscillator to detune the second oscillator and cause interesting interactions with the first oscillator. You'll take your output from the combined output (marked by the symbol \u264a\ufe0e) and you can control the relative volume of the two oscillators using the crossfader (marked by the symbol \u03a3). You can play around with this interactive animation to see how detuning and mixing changes the final waveshape: detuning crossfader (\u03a3) This animation just uses the ramp waveshape, but the crossfader takes the mix from each oscillator's mixer, so you can combine many different waveshapes. Here's some sound samples of oscillator stacking: Chorusing # Inspired by the original Juno's analog chorus circuit, Castor & Pollux contains an adaptation of chorusing that works well for a monophonic voice. Instead of applying the chorus affect after sound generation, Castor & Pollux's chorusing works by varying the frequency of the second oscillator using an internal low-frequency oscillator. This means that you have to use both oscillators in order to hear this effect. The chorusing knob (marked by the symbol \u03c6) determines the amount of chorusing from none when fully counter-clockwise to its maximum at fully clockwise. The crossfader (marked by the symbol \u03a3) also has an impact on the intensity of the chorus. You can play around with this interactive animation to see how the chorusing amount changes the final waveshape. You'll need to click on the animation to start it otherwise you won't really be able to see the chorusing effect. chorusing amount (\u03c6) Here's some sound samples of chorusing: Hard sync # Hard sync is a feature seen in several synthesizer voices that have two or more oscillators, however, it's not a feature seen on the original Juno because each voice only had one oscillator. Since Castor & Pollux has two oscillators to work with it has an adaption of hard sync. Hard sync allows you to sync the second oscillator to the first - the output will retain the same base frequency as the first oscillator but the waveshape will be impacted by the frequency of the second oscillator. In other words, it'll sound like the same note but have a much different timbre. To use hard sync press the hard sync button - the LEDs should all change to the same color. You'll use the first oscillator's pitch CV to set the note and you'll use the second oscillator's pitch knob or pitch CV input to control the timbre. You'll take the output from the second oscillator (or the combined output) - since hard sync does not impact the waveshape of the first oscillator. Here's some sound samples of hard sync: Heads up Due to the wave hard sync works, you shouldn't set the second oscillator to a lower frequency than the first. It'll just result in the sound growing softer since the second oscillator doesn't have enough time to output a complete wave cycle. Editing module settings # Even though Castor & Pollux uses analog circuitry to make its beautiful sounds, there is a little microcontroller brain inside that's orchestrating everything. There's a few settings you can tweak over USB, such as the LED brightness and the range of the pitch knobs. Head over to the web-based settings editor to tweak to your heart's content. Updating the firmware # Download the latest firmware from GitHub . It will be a .uf2 file. Connect Castor & Pollux to your computer via USB. The USB port is located underneath the panel. Note that you still have to power the module from a Eurorack power supply. Place Castor & Pollux in bootloader mode by pressing the reset button twice quickly. The reset button is located just below the USB port. Once in bootloader mode, you should see a drive on your computer named GEMINIBOOT . Copy the uf2 file from step 1 to the GEMINIBOOT drive. The module should restart by itself. Open source hardware & software # Castor & Pollux is completely open source and hacking is encouraged. The firmware is available under the MIT License . The hardware design is available under the CC BY-SA 4.0 License and is designed using KiCAD which is free and open-source. You can open the hardware files using KiCAD or you can check out a PDF of the schematics for the mainboard and the jackboard . Acknowledgments and thanks # Castor & Pollux would not be possible without the help of the Adafruit, support from Microchip, and the volumes of literature documenting and analyzing the Juno's DCO design.","title":"User Guide"},{"location":"#castor-pollux-user-guide","text":"Castor & Pollux is a Roland Juno-inspired oscillator.

Don't worry - it'll be ready to use before we start shipping units! This page uses WebMIDI to communicate with Castor & Pollux and modify internal settings. This works in Google Chrome , Microsoft Edge , and Opera ( full list of supported browsers ). To use this editor: Connect your Castor & Pollux to your Eurorack power supply. The module must be powered by the Eurorack power supply. Connect a USB cable from your computer to Castor & Pollux's USB port. It's located on the right side of the module on the bottom circuit board. Click the connect button, and when prompted, allow the page access to your MIDI devices. Once connected the editor will appear and load the current settings from your device. Once you're done editing, click the save button at the bottom of the editor. You'll need to restart your module for the changes to take effect. If you run into issues, feel free to reach out . Connect Settings editor LED brightness The following settings set the range of the pitch knobs for each oscillator. By default, they have a range of -1.01 to 1.01 octaves (volts). The value of the pitch knob is added to the pitch CV input Castor pitch knob minimum octaves (volts) Castor pitch knob maximum octaves (volts) Pollux pitch knob minimum octaves (volts) Pollux pitch knob maximum octaves (volts) The following settings control the intensity and frequency of the chorusing feature. The intensity of the chorus is determined by the chorus knob and its range is set by the maximum intensity setting. The chorus operates at a fixed frequency determined by the frequency setting. Chorus maximum intensity percent Chorus frequency hertz The following settings control how the module filters the pitch CV inputs. Due to inherent limitations with converting analog pitch CV to a digital pitch value, such as noise and transient errors, it's necessary to basically low-pass filter (or slew limit ) the readings. The module's filter is a little more sophisticated than that- it is a self-modulated low-pass filter. The initial gain setting settings the minimum affect of a new reading on the ongoing average - so if it is 0.1% then it will effect the ongoing average by 10%, if it is 1.0 then previous readings are essentially ignored because it effects the ongoing average by 100%. The sensitivity setting determines how much the low-pass filter can self-modulate. Higher settings means that the module will be more reactive to large changes in the CV input, whereas lower settings will cause the module to react very slowly to any change in the CV input. CV smoothing initial gain percent CV smoothing sensitivity x multiplier Danger zone These settings are calibrated during assembly and do not have default values . Changing these settings can cause your module to behave incorrectly. It's highly recommended that you write down these settings before making changes in case you need to restore them. Let me edit dangerous settings The following setting controls how Pollux determines when to follow Castor. The intended behavior is that when no cable is attached to Pollux's pitch CV jack, it will follow Castor's pitch. The module detects this condition by seeing if the input jack is reading 0 volts. Sometimes due to ADC errors this threshold needs to be adjusted. Lower thresholds may lead to glitchy behavior as the ADC noise measures above and below the threshold, and higher settings may lead to Pollux ignoring the pitch CV input on lower notes. Pollux follower threshold code points The following settings determine how the module corrects for gain and offset errors in its ADC.
